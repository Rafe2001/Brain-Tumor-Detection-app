## About
The "Brain Tumor Detection" project is an advanced deep learning application designed to detect brain tumors in medical images, such as MRI scans. It plays a crucial role in assisting medical professionals with early and accurate brain tumor diagnosis, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

### Algorithm Overview
This project employs a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to perform brain tumor classification. The CNN is trained on a diverse dataset of brain MRI scans, enabling it to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor images with remarkable accuracy. With a validation accuracy of over 91% and a training accuracy exceeding 96%, the model demonstrates its robustness and effectiveness.

## Demo
You can experience the Brain Tumor Detection application in action through our live demo at .

## Features
- **Accurate Tumor Detection**: The deep learning model accurately detects brain tumors in MRI scans.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface simplifies the process of uploading and analyzing medical images.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The application provides real-time predictions using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- **Data Augmentation**: During model training, data augmentation techniques are employed to enhance accuracy further.
- **Healthcare Integration** (Optional): Integration with other healthcare systems for seamless data sharing can be implemented.
